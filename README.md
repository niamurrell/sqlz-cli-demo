# Node Express Sequelize Demo Using `sequelize-cli`

This demo sets up a bare bones Node/Express/Postgres API using Sequelize to manipulate the data, and `sequelize-cli` to create the models and migrations.

This is based on [this](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-node-express-and-postgres-using-sequelize) blog post ([repo here](https://github.com/waiyaki/postgres-express-node-tutorial/tree/master/server)).

However it does *not* demonstrate usage of migrations or actually migrating data.
